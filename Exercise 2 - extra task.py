# Task 1: Arithmetic and Assignment Operators (Advanced)

# TODO: Initialize a variable z with any value.
z = 17

# TODO: Subtract 5 from z using the -= operator.
z -= 5

# TODO: Add the value of x to z using the += operator (Assume x is already defined).
x = 14

z += x
# TODO: Divide z by 3 using the /= operator and store the result back in z.
z /= 3

# TODO: Print the final value of z.
print(z)

# Task 2: Nested Comparison and Logical Operators

# TODO: Initialize three variables p, q, and r with different values.
p = 25
q = 23 
r = 16

# TODO: Create a condition that checks if p is greater than q OR r is greater than q.
if p > q :
    print 
# TODO: Also, check if p is less than or equal to r AND q is an even number.
# TODO: Combine these conditions using logical operators to create a 'complex_condition'.
# TODO: Print the value of 'complex_condition'.

# Task 3: Complex Conditional Statements

# TODO: Ask the user to input their age and store it in a variable 'age'.
# TODO: If the age is 18 or above, print "Eligible to vote."
# TODO: If the age is between 13 and 17 (inclusive), print "Teenager."
# TODO: If the age is below 13, check if it is an even or odd number.
# TODO: Print whether they are "even-aged" or "odd-aged" based on the result.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task 4: Comparing Three Numbers

# TODO: Ask the user to input three numbers: a, b, and c.
# TODO: Compare the three numbers and print which one is the largest.
# TODO: If all three numbers are equal, print "All numbers are equal."
# TODO: If two numbers are equal and larger than the third, print the appropriate message.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task 5: Advanced Arithmetic and Logical Operations

# TODO: Ask the user to input two numbers: x and y.
# TODO: If both x and y are positive, print their sum.
# TODO: If both x and y are negative, print their product.
# TODO: If one of them is positive and the other is negative, print their absolute difference.
# TODO: If both are zero, print "Both are zero."
